        We want to be sure our algorithm samples the arrays at
        representative spots (assuming signal will be non-uniform).
        So, we start by looking at 3 points in each of 3 chambers.
        The 3 points are across the center of the chamber in X
        (X is the fast axis of the stage), so we do left edge, center,
        and right edge.

        For each chamber, we 'use' the position which gives the median
        metric value.  We therefore end up with a list of 3 points, one
        per chamber.  These 3 points are the ones used to determine the gains
        for all colors.  We determine the 'optimal' gain according to our
        metric, then take the median of these optima, and that becomes
        our gain for that color during the current cycle of acquisition.

        start by imaging all 9 positions in one color (Cy5)
        for each of the positions in chamberX/Y, we need to expand
        from the single, center, position to center, left and right
